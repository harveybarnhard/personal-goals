I use this repository to keep track of my progress in these major areas:

1. Fitness (Data pulled from Strava)
2. Language learning (Data pulled from Duolingo)
3. Books read (Manual because GoodReads API no longer active) (in progress)
4. Blog posts (Data pulled from [harveybarnhard.com](https://harveybarnhard.com)) (in progress)
